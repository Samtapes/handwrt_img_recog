To test this program you have to:

- Have PyTorch and Numpy installed in your machine
- Create 'data' folder inside project folder
- Create 'images' folder
- Drawn a white number with black background with 28x28 pixels (I recommend to use the Paint)
- Save the number as 'your_number.png'. ex: '9.png'
- Run the 'run.py' in the terminal: run.py
- Then just type the image full name ex: '7.png'
